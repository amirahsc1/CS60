/* 
Create a base class called Vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type string),
number of cylinders in the engine (type int), and owner (type Person given in the
code that follows). Then create a class called Truck that is derived from Vehicle
and has additional properties, the load capacity in tons (type double since it may
contain a fractional part) and towing capacity in pounds (type int). Be sure your
classes have a reasonable complement of constructors and accessor methods, an
overloaded assignment operator, and a copy constructor. Write a driver program
that tests all your methods.*/
