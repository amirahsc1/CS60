//The program asks the user if he or she wants to convert lengths or weights. If the user chooses lengths,
// then the program asks the user if he or she wants to convert from feet and inches to meters and centimeters 
//or from meters and centimeters to feet and inches. If the user chooses weights, a similar question about 
// pounds, ounces,
//  kilograms, and grams is asked. The program then performs the desired conversion. Have the user respond 
//  by typing the integer 1 for one type of conversion and 2 for the other. The program reads the userâ€™s 
//  answer and then executes an if-else statement. Each branch of the if-else statement will be a function 
//  call. The two functions called in the if-else statement will have function definitions that are very 
//  similar to the programs for Programming Projects 4.6 and 4.9. Thus, these functions will be fairly 
//  complicated function definitions that call other functions; however, they will be very easy to write 
//  by adapting the programs you wrote for Programming Projects 4.6 and 4.9. Notice that your program will 
//  have if-else statements embedded inside of if-else statements, but only in an indirect way. The outer 
//  if-else statement will include two function calls, as its two branches. These two function calls will 
//  each in turn include an if-else statement, but you need not think about that. They are just function 
//  calls and the details are in a black box that you create when you define these functions. If you try to
// create a four-way branch, you are probably on the wrong track. You should only need to think about 
// two-way branches (even though the entire program does ultimately branch into four cases). Include a
// loop that lets the user repeat this computation for new input values until the user says he or she
//  wants to end the program.
